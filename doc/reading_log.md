## \cite{McCullagh:2005:ExchAndReg}

McCullagh essentially defines exchangeability in the context of regression models. This is important because, in a setting in which the distribution of the variables of interest (response variable here) depend on another covariate (even if given), then exchangeability can never be attained, by construction. McCullagh argues that exchangeability is related to the joint distribution not of the specific sample but of the random variables which we observe. He also mentions how this applies to Gaussian Regression, although he does not study this in-depth. No Bayesian point of view, for example.
