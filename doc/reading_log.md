## McCullagh (2005)
McCullagh essentially defines exchangeability in the context of regression models. This is important because, in a setting in which the distribution of the variables of interest (response variable here) depends on another covariate (even if given), then exchangeability can never be attained, by construction. McCullagh argues that exchangeability is related to the joint distribution not of the specific sample but of the random variables which we observe. He also mentions how this applies to Gaussian Regression, although he does not study this in-depth. No Bayesian point of view, for example.

## Campbell et al. (2019)
The authors introduce the notion of *local exchangeability*, which is weaker than exact exchangeability in that permutations in the order of the sequence are allowed to perturb the joint distribution, albeit in a bounded way. They also discuss the difference with partial exchangeability, and prove a de Finetti-like representation theorem for locally exchangeable sequences. I will use this paper to relate GPs to local exchangeability (which the authors do in the paper).

## Diaconis and Freedman (1978) and Diaconis (1988)
Discussion on local exchangeability and its consequences. In both cases a representation theorem is stated, although I will use the one in Diaconis (1988) because it is more general. Sufficiency is discussed in depth, especially its relation to exchangeability. I might go into it in my project, if space allows.

## Lauritzen (1974)
Discusses sufficiency in very general settings. Mentions de Finetti's ideas in a paragraph, but I will not include this in the paper because it is not sufficiently (hehehe) related to the topic.

## Camerlenghi et al. (2019)
The authors discuss partial exchangeability in hierarchical processes. Might include it as a reference in the paper to some uses of partial exchangebaility, but will not go into detail because it is too specific to discuss.
